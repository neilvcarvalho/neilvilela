### Hi, I'm Neil 👋

I'm a developer who loves creating and maintaining products that makes people's lives better.

- ⚕️ I've had academic experience in telemedicine and health tech. I'd _love_ to work on that subject, too.
- ⚗️ I try some Elixir programming now and then and it's very likely my next language.
- 📫 Reach me at: **me@neil.pro**
- 🐉 My first experience with coding was creating a Pokémon game on top of mIRC. Check it out at https://github.com/neilvilela/PkBR
