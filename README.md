### Hi, I'm Neil 👋

I've been working for the last 9 years in making brazilian entrepreneurs worry less about bureaucracy and more about how to manage their companies.

- ⚕️ I've had academic experience in telemedicine and health tech. I'd _love_ to work on that subject, too.
- 🌱 I'm currently studying React and sharpening my front-end skills.
- ⚗️ I try some Elixir programming now and then and it's very likely my next language.

- 🐉 My first experience with coding was creating a Pokémon game on top of mIRC. Check it out at https://github.com/neilvilela/PkBR
